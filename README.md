# RGP-Square
This project is a simple RGB Color Cycling square implemented using Python and the Tkinter library for GUI development. It features a visual square that cycles through the primary RGB colors (red, green, and blue) at a fast interval. The user can control the cycling with "Start RGB" and "Stop RGB" buttons.
